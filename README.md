<br />

This library exists to allow substrate developers to:
 - [x] Test complex pallets that require a full runtime, not a mocked runtime.
 - [x] Test a combination of both onchain & offchain components (eg offchain workers)
 - [x] Fork your live chain state and execute transactions from any origin.
 - [x] Simulate runtime upgrades & migrations.


## Documentation

Installation and integration guides can be found in the [book](https://simnode.polytope.technology). Example integrations are provided for runtimes of all different kinds:

- [x] [Standalone Chain](/examples/aura), AURA leader election, GRANDPA consensus.
- [X] [Standalone Chain](/examples/babe), BABE leader election, GRANDPA consensus.
- [X] [Parachain](/examples/parachain), AURA leader election, Polkadot Consensus.

## Releases

`sc-simnode` exclusively follows the official [paritytech/polkadot-sdk](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/releases) stable releases. Therefore new versions of this crate will be published with the same semver version of the corresponding polkadot-sdk stable release.
